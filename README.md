Ferretcoin (FRT) is a digital currency in the spirit of Dogecoin. Ferrets are cute little thieves, and Lily, the mascot of Ferretcoin, inspired the currency by literally stealing the keys of her keeper. Shiny!

Ferretcoin will be a fork of Dash, because, like Dash, Ferrets are sneaky sleepers that wake up on schedule, always follow the secret procedures, and get everything done almost instantly. 

Ferretcoin will donate a portion of all procedes to animal-related charities, at first addressing the adrenal gland disease which Lily and 30% of domestic female ferrets suffer from.

### Dash Child Proof of Concept

If, as the founders of Ferretcoin believe, Dash is an early DAO, then Ferretcoin will be the first child-DAO of Dash. Dash has been very successful with it's governance, but, as yet, has not turned into an ecosystem of sub-tokens and sub-projects, like Ethereum, or other DAO-like projects. While this is not necessarily the goal of Dash, the Ferretcoin project is designed to explore the application of Dash governance and technology for such child-DAOs. If Ferretcoin succeeds, we hope to convince the Dash community to explore many more child-DAOs.

##### Q. How will Ferretcoin use Dash technology?

Ferretcoin will be a fork of Dash, designed for merged mining, and compatibility with other Dash services such as masternode hosting.

##### Q. Will Ferretcoin use the Dash blockchain?

No. Ferretcoin will not use the Dash blockchain directly, but will start it's own blockchain from genesis.

##### Q. What benefit is there to Dash for Ferretcoin to exist? Isn't it competition?

Ferretcoin is like a marketing and non-profit arm for the Dash community. By engaging animal lovers across the internet, Ferretcoin will bring Dash technology to new users in a fun way. These users' first impression of Dash will be as the technology that allows them to help and enjoy images of furry animals.

##### Q. What innovations will Ferretcoin have over Dash?

Ferretcoin isn't designed to leapfrog Dash in terms of features, but rather to apply Dash's existing features to a new problem: charity. By keeping the technical scope of the project close to Dash-core, Ferretcoin will be able to benefit from all future Dash development, and potentially contribute code back. Furthermore, by intentionally only making superficial technology changes, minimal barrier to entry for miners, masternode operators, and other Dash service providers is ensured.

Ferretcoin will be to Dash what Dogecoin is to Bitcoin. Hopefully even better, though!

## Roles

+ Token Holder
+ Miner
+ Node
+ Business Node
+ Administrator

Token Holders are parties in control of the Ferretcoin private keys.

Miners are straight POW (X11) computers, just like in Bitcoin or Dash. Miners will receive 33% of block rewards.

Nodes are standard, non-collateralized nodes, again just like Bitcoin or Dash (non-masternodes).

Business Nodes are just like Dash masternodes. Business Nodes will be required to collateralize their node with at least 100 FRT. Business Nodes will receive a portion (33%) of the block rewards, and vote on the dispensation of the remaining 33% (within the scope of animal-related charities).

The Admnistrator will be responsible for managing the Ferretcoin Foundation charity, which will give 80% or more of the discretionary block rewards to animal-related charities.

## Tasks & Deliverables

Ferretcoin is a lightly modified Dash fork. Some tweaks to the economic model will foster the charitable nature of Ferretcoin, and the rest will be branding and marketing.

## Economics  

### Block Rewards

Block Rewards will be split differently than in Dash, but using the same basic grouping of miners, collateralized nodes, and discretionary budget. Whereas Dash uses a 45:45:10 split, Ferretcoin will use a 33:33:33 split.

### Discretionary Budget Rules

The larger discretionary budget is controlled by Business Node voting, similar to Dash masternodes and budget. Unlike the Dash budget, the Ferretcoin budget has another set of rules which all budget proposals must first meet.

 + 80% or more of the budget must go to a ferret-related charity for every budget dispersion.
 + The Developer (GitGuild), Marketer (200 Social) and Administrator (TBD) must each submit itemized budget proposals for access to the network, and may only be paid out of the 20% overhead allowance.
 + Anyone else may also make and/or fullfill budget proposals, subject to the profit/non-profit restrictions above.

### Costs

At this time, the Ferretcoin project is exploring the possibility of Dash network funding. If the Dash network agrees to fund the project, it can get underway very rapidly and with high-quality. If not, a volunteer effort led by Git Guild and 200 Social will take back seat to high priority projects.

*$2,000 Website*

Including domain. GitGuild already purchased: ferretcoin.com, ferretco.in, frtcoin.com, frtco.in, and icanhascoins.com. Must be sexy and funny. Success is in marketing and branding for Ferretcoin.

*$2,000 Ferretcoin Dev bounties*

Pretty straight forward fork and tweak on Dash.

*$2,000 Ferretcoin Launch marketing*

The above are really bare minimum costs. Depending on the interest, a scaled up version might make good use of a budget 10x this size.
